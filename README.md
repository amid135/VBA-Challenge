# VBA-Challenge
Welcome to the VBA Challenge project! This assignment involves using VBA scripting to analyze stock market data across multiple quarters. Below, you'll find instructions on setting up the project, details about each task, and what you need to deliver.

Before You Begin
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Repository Setup:
- Create a new repository named VBA-challenge specifically for this project.
- This assignment should not be added to an existing repository.

Folder Structure:
- Inside your newly created repository, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment.
- Ensure that each VBA file will serve as the main script for its respective analysis.

Files to Download:
- Download the challenge files from the provided link to help you get started with the dataset.

Version Control:
- Commit your VBA script(s) to your repository.
- Push your changes to GitHub or GitLab for version control.

Tasks Overview
Your VBA script should accomplish the following objectives:

Loop Through Stocks:
- Create a script that loops through all the stock data for each quarter.
- Output the following information for each stock:
- Ticker symbol
- Quarterly change from the opening price to the closing price
- Percentage change from the opening price to the closing price
- Total stock volume

Highlighting with Conditional Formatting:
- Use conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

Additional Functionalities:
- Enhance your script to determine and output:
- Stock with the "Greatest % increase"
- Stock with the "Greatest % decrease"
- Stock with the "Greatest total volume"
- Scaling Across Worksheets:

Modify your VBA script to run on every worksheet (quarter) at once, ensuring consistent behavior and output across all datasets.

Additional Considerations
- Utilize the provided dataset (alphabetical_testing.xlsx) initially for faster testing and validation.
- Ensure that your script is efficient and capable of handling larger datasets without significant performance issues.
- Document your code thoroughly with comments to explain the logic and functionality of each section.

Conclusion

By completing the VBA Challenge, you'll gain valuable experience in automating data analysis tasks using VBA scripting, which is a powerful tool for processing and visualizing large datasets in Excel.
